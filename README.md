# Rules
Game consists of two 'players', which are represented in game by 'programming languages'
At the start of a game, both players start with 4 cards and 30 'health' points.
Turns alternate between the two players. A players turn ends when they end their turn or a time runs out. (time tbd)

On a given players turn, they start by drawing a card from their deck.
They can then proceed to play cards from their hand and 'attack' the opponent

Once a players 'health' depleats to 0, the other player wins the game.

If their deck runs out of cards, instead of drawing a card at the start of a turn they take damage.
 -- This damage should increase as the number of turns with an empty deck increases (exact numbders tbd)
